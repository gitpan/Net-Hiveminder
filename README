DESCRIPTION
    Hiveminder is a collaborate todo list organizer, built with Jifty.

    This module uses Hiveminder's REST API to let you manage your tasks any
    way you want to.

    This module is built on top of Net::Jifty. Consult that module's
    documentation for the lower-level interface.

  display_tasks TASKS
    This will take a list of hash references, "TASKS", and convert each to a
    human-readable form.

    In scalar context it will return the readable forms of these tasks
    joined by newlines.

  get_tasks ARGS
    Runs a search with "ARGS" for tasks. There are no defaults here, so this
    can be used for anything.

    Returns a list of hash references, each one being a task. Use
    "display_tasks" if necessary.

  todo_tasks [ARGS]
    Returns a list of hash references, each one a task. This uses the same
    query that the home page of Hiveminder uses. The optional "ARGS" will be
    passed as well so you can narrow down your todo list.

  todo [ARGS]
    Returns a list of tasks in human-readable form. The optional "ARGS" will
    be passed as well so you can narrow down your todo list.

    In scalar context it will return the concatenation of the tasks.

  create_task SUMMARY
    Creates a new task with "SUMMARY".

  read_task LOCATOR
    Load task "LOCATOR".

  update_task LOCATOR, ARGS
    Update task "LOCATOR" with "ARGS".

  delete_task LOCATOR
    Delete task "LOCATOR".

  braindump TEXT[, TOKENS]
    Braindumps "TEXT". "TOKENS" may be used to provide default attributes to
    all the braindumped tasks (this is part of what the filter feature of
    Hiveminder's IM bot does).

  upload_text TEXT
    Uploads "TEXT" to BTDT::Action::UploadTasks.

  upload_file FILENAME
    Uploads "FILENAME" to BTDT::Action::UploadTasks.

  download_text
    Downloads your tasks. This also gets the metadata so that you can edit
    the text and upload it, and it'll make the same changes to your task
    list.

    This does not currently accept query arguments, because Hiveminder
    expects a "/not/owner/me/group/personal" type argument string, when all
    we can produce is "owner_not => 'me', group => 'personal'"

  download_file FILENAME
    Downloads your tasks and puts them into "FILENAME".

    This does not currently accept query arguments, because Hiveminder
    expects a "/not/owner/me/group/personal" type argument string, when all
    we can produce is "owner_not => 'me', group => 'personal'"

  priority (NUMBER | TASK) -> Maybe String
    Returns the "word" of a priority. One of: lowest, low, normal, high,
    highest. If the priority is out of range, "undef" will be returned.

  done LOCATORS
    Marks the given tasks as complete.

  tasks2ids LOCATORS -> IDS
    Transforms the given record locators (or tasks) to regular IDs.

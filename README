DESCRIPTION
    Hiveminder is a collaborate todo list organizer, built with Jifty.

    This module uses Hiveminder's REST API to let you manage your tasks any
    way you want to.

    This module is built on top of Net::Jifty. Consult that module's
    documentation for the lower-level interface.

  display_tasks TASKS
    This will take a list of hash references (tasks) and convert them to
    human-readable form.

    In scalar context it will return the tasks joined by newlines.

  get_tasks ARGS
    Runs a search (with ARGS) for tasks. There are no defaults here, so this
    can be used for anything.

  todo_tasks [ARGS]
    Returns a list of hash references, each one a task. This uses the same
    query that the home page of Hiveminder uses.

  todo [ARGS]
    Returns a list of tasks in human-readable form. Additional arguments
    will be included in the search.

    In scalar context it will return the concatenation of the tasks.

  create_task SUMMARY
    Creates a new task with the given summary.

  read_task Locator
    Load a task with the given record locator.

  update_task Locator, Args
    Takes a record locator and uses it to update that task with Args.

  delete_task Locator
    Takes a record locator and uses it to delete that task.

  braindump Text[, Tokens]
    Braindumps the given text. You may also pass a string of tokens to give
    defaults to each of the braindumped tasks.

  email_of id
    Take a user ID and retrieve that user's email address.

  canonicalize_priority priority
    Attempts to understand a variety of different priority formats and
    change it to the standard 1-5. This will "confess" if it doesn't
    understand the priority.
